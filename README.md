| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Client** | Game modes, HUD, scoring overlay, leaderboards and auth. Phaser renders the duel scene, and React handles UI and state. |
| **Game API** | Auth, AI-generated scenarios, saving performance results (reaction time, accuracy), feedback and leaderboards. Socket.IO provides real-time updates. |
| **AI service** | Opponent decision-making from the current game state, difficulty-based personalities, and LLM-generated strategy and scenario text. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser with ES6+ support

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Backend services

```bash
# Game API (Express + MongoDB + Socket.IO) — configure src/backend/.env from .env.example
cd src/backend
npm install
npm run dev            # nodemon app.js (API on :3001 per frontend config)

# AI service (FastAPI) — needs GEMINI_API_KEY in ai_service/.env
cd ai_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py         # http://localhost:5001
```

## 🎮 How to Play

### Duel Mode Instructions
1. **Choose Training Mode**: Select "High Noon Duel" from the mode selection
2. **Read Scenario**: Review the AI opponent and environment details
3. **Prepare for Draw**: Wait for the countdown (3... 2... 1...)
4. **DRAW!**: Click/tap when "DRAW!" appears - speed is crucial
5. **Aim and Fire**: Click on your opponent to shoot
6. **Review Results**: Analyze your performance and aim for improvement

### Controls
- **Mouse/Touch**: Click/tap to shoot
- **Spacebar**: Alternative shoot button
- **ESC**: Pause/resume game
- **Enter**: Confirm selections in menus

## 📈 Scoring System

### Performance Metrics
- **Reaction Time**: How quickly you respond to "DRAW!" (measured in milliseconds)
- **Accuracy**: How precisely you hit your target (percentage)
- **Strategy Rating**: Overall tactical execution (0-100%)
- **Final Score**: Calculated composite score (0-100 points)

### Grade Scale
- **S (90-100)**: Legendary performance
- **A (80-89)**: Excellent skills
- **B (70-79)**: Good fundamentals
- **C (60-69)**: Fair ability
- **D (50-59)**: Needs improvement
- **F (0-49)**: More training required
